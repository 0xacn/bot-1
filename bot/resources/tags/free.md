**How to claim a channel**

We recently moved to a new help channel system. There are always 2 available help channels waiting to be claimed in the **Python Help: Available category**. In order to claim one, simply start typing your question into one of these channels. Once your question has been posted, you have claimed this channel, and the channel will be moved down to the **Python Help: Occupied category**.

If you're unable to type into these channels, this means you're currently on cooldown. In order to prevent someone from claiming all the channels for themselves, we only allow someone to claim a new help channel every 15 minutes. However, if you close your help channel using the `!dormant` command, this cooldown is reset early.
