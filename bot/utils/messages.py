        message (Message):
            The message that should be monitored for reactions
            and possibly deleted. Must be a message sent on a

            A sequence of users that are allowed to delete
            this message.

    Kwargs:
        deletion_emojis (Sequence[str]):
            A sequence of emojis that are considered deletion
            emojis.

        timeout (float):
            A positive float denoting the maximum amount of
            time to wait for a deletion reaction.

        attach_emojis (bool):
            Whether to attach the given `deletion_emojis`
            to the message in the given `context`

        client (Optional[discord.Client]):
            The client instance handling the original command.
            If not given, will take the client from the guild
            of the message.
